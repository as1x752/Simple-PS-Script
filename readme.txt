Script will get contents of directory and store 
to array which then loops through to compare 
whether directories exist or not. If directory
exists, it will log to text file. If directory 
does not, proceed to copy from whatever directory
you like. Script can be used in with Windows Task 
Scheduler to automate the process.

This is my very first commit, so I figured it
should be something simple that I created.

Script is provided as-is free of charge with no
waranty. :)

Feel free to fork and modify to your hearts 
content.
